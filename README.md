# redistio

`redistio` is a new and experimental project. Some commits to the main
branch may contain temporary features while I figure out what I like for
the defaults. The current approach is to (1) figure out a free,
open-source, and shiny-based approach to GUI redistricting, (2) develop
friendly defaults, (3) extend the interface to make the app entirely
customizable. Eventually, customization will be through lists of
defaults that can be replaced (or added to). Progress will be slow and
in bursts, as I find uses that fit my research needs. No guarantees are
made to any features until the first stable release is on CRAN.
